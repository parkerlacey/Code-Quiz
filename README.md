# Code Quiz
## Description
Test your knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Javascript! Select a quiz category you would like to take. Then, click the "Start Quiz!" button to begin the quiz. You will be presented with a multiple-choice question, and will be alerted if you have selected a right or wrong answer. Be careful though, every time you select a wrong answer, you lose 15 points from your score!

The quiz is over when you have completed all questions correctly, or the timer reaches 0. You will then be asked to enter your initials, where you will then be added and sorted into the leaderboards.
